Do I need to be in the directory to track the files and push them? Or can I be anywhere?
 when I push where I am going to upload it to, Class or Test.
And is it going to allow me to do it? Is it going to copy it in the dir I have? or when I fetch will be like having a new update even it has been me who push it?

If I change this and then pull let's see what happens. Let's delete something form above paragraph
